# This is a repository for creating cloudformation template for HANA (Scale-up)
This colutformation template will be used to deploy SAP HANA system on the AWS Cloud for scale-up scenario. I have followed best practices from AWS and SAP to deploy HANA on AWS in this template. 
SAP HANA is an in-memory relational database and application platform that provides high-performance analytics and real-time data processing.
AWS provides SAP customers and partners with an SAP-certified cloud infrastructure to run SAP HANA. 

With this template you can deploy SAP HANA on RHEL 7.x. 

The scenario you can follow to deploy the solution is as below:

Provisioning HANA Master node and Installaing SAP HANA into an existing VPC on AWS
